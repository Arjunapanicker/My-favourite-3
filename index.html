    <h1>My favourite activity cycling</h1>
      <div class="line"></div> <p>It is my favorite sports to do whenever I have free time. Not just because of it good for our health, if we also can enjoy the scenery and feel the natural winds. It is a good exercise to improve family relationships or a friend's relationships. All-in-all cycling is a beneficial physical activity and hobby.<br></br></p>

<h2>Cycling is a fun activity</h2>
<p>The easy speed of cycling is what makes it so much fun. Sailing along at 15mph on a nimble-handling, lightweight bike, feeling the cooling breezes, carving corners and zipping down hills â€” cycling is the closest thing you can experience to flying without wings.</p>
